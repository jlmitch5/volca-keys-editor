# Volca Keys editor

Web-based editor for Korg Volca Keys synthesizers

## Requirements

* Browser supporting Web MIDI (only Google Chrome as of today)
* Volca Keys connected to MIDI output interface

## Development

```sh
# npm is fine too
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

## Design

Yes, the design is absolutely horrible, but it works.
If you're a designer and want to contribute, create an issue or send a PR and I'd be happy to help.
